# Stockfighter-Solutions
## Overview
This repository contains my personal attempts to solve the Stockfighter programming challenges located [here](https://www.stockfighter.io/).  If you're interested in attempting the Stockfighter programming challenges yourself, I encourage you to come up with your own solutions yourself before looking at mine.  Not that mine are anything special anyway.  I decided to write my solutions using Python 3.5.1 (64-bit) on Windows 7
